This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

##System Requirements
#### Operating System
Create React App works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

####Node.js
You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to easily switch Node versions between different projects.
